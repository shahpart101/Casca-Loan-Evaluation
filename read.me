Casca Loan Evaluation is an AI-powered system designed to analyze and extract insights from bank statements, automating financial analysis to assist businesses and lenders in making informed loan decisions. The project features a backend for PDF processing, financial data extraction, and interest rate modeling, alongside a frontend for user interaction.

The system includes interest rate models that assess loan viability based on extracted financial data. These models evaluate income stability, spending patterns, and cash flow trends to generate a dynamic interest rate tailored to an applicantâ€™s financial profile. By leveraging statistical and machine learning techniques, the system improves the accuracy of loan risk assessment.

The backend, built with Python and Flask, processes data, while the React-based frontend provides an intuitive interface for users. The project is deployed using Render (backend) and Vercel (frontend), ensuring accessibility and scalability.
